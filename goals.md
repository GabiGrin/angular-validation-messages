Validation directive goals:
-Enable quick and simple out-of-the-box validation for forms
-Provide built in messages for most common validation errors around
-Enable custom error messages, configurable both per project and per form control element
-Allow custom validation checks with minimum effort and syntax
-Easy RegEx validation without implementing a custom boilerplate function
-Customizable reaction on validation errors - either show messages only at submit, or immediately / onBlur
-Allow scrolling to the first invalid form control to ensure user's attention
-Enter and exit css classes for nice looking visual effects
-Configurable error message template, both per project and per form control element
-Relies solely on ng-model to work, and can be attached to any other directive that may need validation
-Native bootstrap support
